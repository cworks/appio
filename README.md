appio

I'm not gonna lie I drew inspiration for this idea/code from the wonderful
Node.js web framework, express.js (which I love love love).  However I do
a lot of work in Java so I'd like to have something similar...from a feature
and simplicity perspective.  Its NOT a Java port of express.js because I
don't wish to do such tedious work but from an API/clients perspective I
like their ideas and simplicity so I'm drawing what I like and augmenting
where needed.  Yes there are several other Micro Frameworks out there such
as SparkJava but those are fairly limited in terms of carving up URLs
and its tied to Jetty.  My *hope* is to separate the container from the App.
